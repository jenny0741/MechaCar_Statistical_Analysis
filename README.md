### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

3 Takeaways:
1. Variance of a non-random variable is typically zero (0). Taking that into consideration, the coefficients for the intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance all provide a non-random amount of variance.
2. The slope of the linear model would be considered zero if the null hypothesis is accepted. However, the p-value < 0.05, indicating that the null hypothesis can be rejected so the slope cannot be considered zero.
3. When performing a line regression, the r-squared value should be as close to 1 as possible. Based on the multiple r-squared value (0.71) and adjusted r-squared value (0.68), the linear model predicts mpg well, but a different statistical test is recommended.
